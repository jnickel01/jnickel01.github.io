    <h1>Modified Blackjack Game</h1>
    <h2>How To Play</h2>

    <p>In this game you will be asked if you would like to draw another card. The computer will then pick a random number between 1 and 10 for you and display them in some way (i.e. on the screen, in an alert box, in text boxes on a form, etc.) as well as providing the total of all of your cards. If the total of your cards is over 21 you automatically lose that round.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have 21 or less, the computer always draws 3 cards (also between 1 and 10). If the computer goes over 21 you win, if you both have the same total you draw, if the computer is higher than you (but less than or equal to 21) it wins, and if the computer is lower than you, you win.
